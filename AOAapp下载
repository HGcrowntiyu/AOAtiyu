This is a WordPress code snippet for displaying a widget that shows the 8 most viewed posts on a website. It is using a WP_query to get the posts with the most views by sorting them in descending order according to their meta value for the 'views' meta key.

The code starts by defining a div container with a class of 'widget' and a heading with the text "Bài viết xem nhiều" (Most viewed posts). Inside the widget, there is a div with a class of 'content-w' and an unordered list with list items that display the title of each post.

To get the most viewed posts, the code first creates a new instance of WP_query and sets the query arguments to show only published posts with a post type of 'post', sort them in descending order based on their 'views' meta key value, and limit the results to 8 posts. Then, a while loop is used to iterate over each post returned by the query and display its title as a link to its permalink.

Finally, the wp_reset_postdata() function is called to restore the original post data, as the loop modifies the global $wp_query object. This code snippet can be used in a WordPress theme's sidebar or footer to display a widget with the most viewed posts on the website.
